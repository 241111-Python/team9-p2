# Project Description - team 9

This project dived into a bank's customer data to uncover interesting patterns. It read data from a default CSV file or one provided by the user, analyzing things like how credit scores vary based on age and gender, and how the number of products a customer has affects their points. We also looked at how long a customer has been with the bank and how it might relate to their credit score. To efficiently handle and display large datasets, we used a technique called pagination. Finally, we presented our analysis in a clear and concise JSON format.
