Draft 1:

   This project will dive into a bank's customer data to uncover interesting patterns. 
   It will read data from a default CSV file or one provided by the user, analyzing things like 
   how credit scores vary based on age and gender, and how the number of products a customer has 
   affects their points. We will also look at how long a customer has been with the bank and how 
   it might relate to their credit score. To efficiently handle large datasets, we will use a technique 
   called pagination. Finally, we will present our analysis in a clear and concise JSON format.
